           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
     
       3.  Dependency 'androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.11.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 35 or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is currently compiled against android-34.
     
           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 35, for example 36.
